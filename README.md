# ðŸ”¢ #100Devs Push Project001: Calculator

### Goal: Build a Simple Calculator using JS OOP best practices

### What it should look like:

### How to submit your code for review:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Create a new branch called answer
- Checkout answer branch
- Push to your fork
- Issue a pull request
- Your pull request description should contain the following:
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I completed the challenge
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I feel good about my code
  - Anything specific on which you want feedback!

Example:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
```
## Optimizations

 - Add keystroke functionality
 - Clean up code + make it dry
 - Fix float errors in a clean manner (e.g. 8.2 - 0.2 = 7.999999)
 - Add comma separation for large numbers (This will probably make all sorts of bugs when converting and consistently displaying arrays, strings, and number)
 - Add edge cases, for example if starting with an operator, adding more than one decimal place
 - What happens if clicking an operator more than ones? Calc should either ignore or present an error
 - Need to comment out code better
 - Need to update this readme!
